Docker networking is a crucial aspect of container management, enabling containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world
 containers can communicate with each other using container IP addresses or container names
You can create custom, user-defined networks, and connect multiple containers to the same network

Types of Docker Networks

Bridge:

Default network driver for containers.
Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other.
Isolated from the host network.
Example: docker run --network bridge

Host:

Uses the host's network stack.
Containers share the host’s IP address and port space.
Best for performance, but can lead to port conflicts.
Example: docker run --network host


None:

Disables all networking for the container.
Useful for specific use cases where no network is required.
Example: docker run --network none


Overlay:

Used for multi-host networking.
Allows containers running on different Docker hosts (using Docker Swarm) to communicate.
Requires a key-value store like etcd, Consul, or Docker’s internal store.
Example: docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network

Macvlan:

Assigns a MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.
Useful for workloads that require direct access to physical networks.
Example: docker network create -d macvlan my_macvlan_network


Docker Networking Commands


Listing Networks:

To see all the networks on your Docker host
#docker network ls


Inspecting a Network:

To get detailed information about a specific network
#docker network inspect <network_name>

Creating a Network:

To create a custom network
#docker network create <network_name>

Removing a Network:

Remove a network (must not be in use)
#docker network rm <network_name>


Connecting a Container to a Network:

To connect an existing container to a specific network
#docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>

Disconnecting a Container from a Network:

To remove a container from a network
#docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>








Docker networking provides a powerful and flexible way to manage how containers communicate with each other and with external resources. 
By understanding the different network types and their configurations, you can effectively design and implement networking for your containerized applications.
